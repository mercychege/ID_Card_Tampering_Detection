 
 ## ID Card Tampering Detection using Computer Vision

An image processing detection model using OpenCV to detect whether the given id is valid or not. 

## Usage

The Jupyter notebook ID_Card_Tampering_Detection.ipynb contains the code for loading and preprocessing the dataset, as well as implementing and evaluating the tampered as well as original image. To run the notebook, simply open it in Jupyter or Google Colab and run each cell in order.

## Results

Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) between the tampered and original image is 31.67%.

## Conclusion

In this project, we understood the application of Structural Similarity Index in computer vision for detecting fake id's and show the contours and threshold on the tampered and original image.
